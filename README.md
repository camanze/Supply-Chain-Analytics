# Supply-Chain-Analytics
A Data-Driven Analysis of a Fashion &amp; Beauty Start-up

## **Introduction** 

Supply chain analytics plays a pivotal role in optimizing operations, reducing costs, and improving profitability. This project analyzes the supply chain of a Fashion & Beauty startup, focusing on makeup products, to uncover key insights into revenue trends, supplier performance, logistics efficiency, and product demand. Using Power BI, I transformed raw supply chain data into actionable business intelligence, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
